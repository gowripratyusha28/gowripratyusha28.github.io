            <h2>Quantum Supremacy</h2>
            <h5>Google may have created the first quantum computer that can perform a calculation impossible on classical computers.</h5>

            <p>Last week, news leaked that researchers at Google and other institutions had solved a problem on a quantum computer 1 billion times faster than a classical computer. Google did not respond to a request for comment, but according to a draft manuscript describing the experiment, they have realized “quantum supremacy,” an achievement that “heralds the advent of a much-anticipated computing paradigm.”</p>

            <p>The reactions from the rest of the quantum community, however, have been downright contradictory. In an email, physicist John Preskill of Caltech calls the work a “truly impressive achievement in experimental physics.” Cautioning that the leaked manuscript is just a draft, mathematician Ashley Montanaro of the University of Bristol says this is a “genuinely exciting moment,” and also that the work is “not of practical relevance.” Dario Gil, the director of research at IBM, disputes the notion of quantum supremacy itself, calling the term “misleading” in a statement to WIRED.</p>

            <p>So which one is true? Did the Google team just clear a steep technological threshold, or has it performed a largely useless experiment dressed up in clever branding? The truth lies somewhere in between, and captures the competing tensions at play in the quantum computing world.</p>

            <p>To understand this, let’s unpack what the Google paper actually describes. The researchers ran the experiment on a quantum computing chip named Sycamore, which contains 54 tiny objects called qubits that they can program to represent the digit 0, 1, or a weighted combination of both, called a superposition.In the quantum supremacy experiment, Google’s scientists designed some pulse sequences that essentially turn their computer into a random number generator. They then made the quantum computer spit out millions of numbers. Though the numbers look random, they are meant to still fall into a pattern prescribed by Google’s algorithm. So they next checked to see if the numbers obeyed that distribution. They did.</p>

            <h2>Screen time</h2>
            <h5>Screen time: How smartphones really affect our bodies and brains
            </h5>

            <p>If you believe the headlines, screens are supposed to warp our skeletons, damage our mental health and alienate us from our families. But the evidence paints a more nuanced picture
            </p>

            <p>YOU’LL get square eyes!” my mother used to say as I sat for hour after hour glued to the TV. I ignored her, of course. It was just something parents said. Fast-forward a few decades and now I’m the parent. My 5-year-old lives in a world where screens aren’t fixed pieces of furniture, but lie around on the kitchen table, on the sofa, by the bed, constantly accessible. You can’t even avoid them by going outside. “Screens are not only in our pockets, they’re on billboards, buses and bins,” says Tim Smith, a psychologist at Birkbeck, University of London.</p>


            <p>The concerns have multiplied with the screens. In the past decade, we have heard that they will rewire our brains, strip us of cognitive abilities and damage our mental health. Many of us feel more distracted by them, feeling grumpier, guiltier and more tired as a result. The list of ills makes square eyes sound benign.

            So should we take these concerns more seriously? Given the amount of time so many of us spend with our lit-up devices, it is an important question.
            </p>

            <p>The trouble is, many of the most emphatic answers are the least reliable. Smartphones and tablets are not only TVs, they are chat rooms, shopfronts, banks and photo albums. We use them to work and play, to record physical activity and monitor sleep. We can look up peer-reviewed papers or scroll through anti-vaxxing forums, crucial distinctions that disappear when we use the umbrella term “screen time”. As the fears grow and the debate becomes ever more</p>

            <h2>End of an Era</h2>
            <h5>A promise of free voice calls for a lifetime and how Reliance Jio turned its back on its most loyal users.</h5>

            <p> Reliance Jio said in a statement that users will now have to pay 6 paise/minute as IUC for phone calls made to other networks. It also said that it had been compelled, most "reluctantly and unavoidably" to resort to this desperate measure due to policy changes.

            Well, technically, that’s not true. Nobody’s holding a gun here and there is no regulation forcing Jio to recover these costs from customers. But before we discuss any of this we need to set the record straight. What on earth is an IUC?</p>


            <p>By some estimates, Jio spent as much as 830 Crores (net) on interconnect charges between April and June this year. So with customers now bearing this load, the company will save a lot of money and it’s likely that this will translate to tangible improvements in its financials.

            But this comes at a cost. One look at Twitter and you’ll notice a bunch of people threatening a complete boycott already. Now it’s hard to say, how many people will follow through with these threats, but I am sure many will start second-guessing their choices now i.e. Is Jio still value for money? Maybe, maybe not.</p>

            <p>Finally, there is one other thing. Earlier this year, there was a lot of talk about TRAI (the telecom regulating authority) wanting to abolish interconnect charges altogether. However that hasn’t materialised yet. And Jio for its part has put the ball squarely in TRAI’s court here. The company has stated that IUC charges will be levied on customers until TRAI removes it completely.</p>

            <h2>Electric Airplane</h2>
            <h5>NASA is building its first electic Airplane</h5>

            <p>NASA is getting ready to test its first all-electric plane, the X-57 Maxwell, at the Armstrong Flight Research Center at California’s Edwards Air Force Base.

            This latest version of the aircraft, called Modification II or Mod II, just arrived at Edwards from San Luis Obispo, California, where the plane was being developed by Empirical Systems Aerospace Inc.</p>

            <p>
              For Mod II, the typical combustion engines have been replaced with electric cruise motors. And with the new engines, NASA can now begin the next phase of testing on the experimental craft, bringing it a step closer to reality.The X-57 is based on a twin-engine Italian aircraft popular among private aviators and known as the Tecnam P2006T. NASA planned four rounds of modifications to take the plane from its base model to a completely electric aircraft.
            </p>

            <p>By exploring technology in electric aircraft, NASA hopes to take a step toward eliminating the carbon footprint from flights. Currently, jet fuel emissions are a major contributor to Earth’s greenhouse gas problem. Throughout testing, NASA plans on sharing the information it learns about the electric plane with the larger industry.

            X-planes, or experimental aircraft, have been a pillar of NASA’s aeronautics sector for a long time. In fact, NASA has been testing X-planes at the Armstrong Flight Research Center since the 1940s.</p>

            <p>
              But most of the aircraft tested there have been focused on high-speed flight. And while the X-57 won’t be fast, it will be the NASA’s crewed X-plane in two decades.

            <h2>Noble Prize</h2>
            <h5>3 Scientists Win Nobel Prize in Chemistry for Developing the Lithium-Ion Battery</h5>

            <p>John B. Goodenough, M. Stanley Whittingham and Akira Yoshino will share this year's Nobel "for the development of lithium-ion batteries," the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said this morning.

            Whittingham, of Binghamton University, State University of New York, while developing technologies for fossil fuel-free energy, discovered an energy-rich material that he used to create a cathode (negatively charged electrode) in a lithium-ion battery. When looked at on the molecular level, that cathode — made from titanium disulfide — had little nooks where lithium ions could hide out. The resulting battery, with metallic lithium as the anode, created 2 volts of power. </p>


            <p>Goodenough, of The University of Texas at Austin, created a similar battery using cobalt oxide (also with little lithium ions hidden in its empty spaces) as the cathode, resulting in as much as 4 volts of power. "This was an important breakthrough and would lead to much more powerful batteries," the Nobel Prize foundation said.</p>

            <p>This battery doesn't rely on chemical reactions as others had and instead relies on the flow of lithium ions between the anode and cathode. The result? A lightweight battery that can be charged hundreds of times before its performance takes a hit. </p>

            <p>Lithium-ion batteries have revolutionized our lives since they first entered the market in 1991. They have laid the foundation of a wireless, fossil fuel-free society, and are of the greatest benefit to humankind," the Nobel Prize foundation said.</p>

            <h2>Energy Grid</h2>
            <h5>How the U.S. could have an All-Renewable Energy Grid</h5>

            <p>Renewable energy systems are location-specific: The best system depends on a location’s resources (is it windy?), its temporal pattern (how often is it not windy?) and availability of complementary sources (is there hydropower for backup?). Despite this location sensitivity, studies in disparate places are finding similar results.

            Having a diversity of renewable sources can reduce costs. In particular, solar and wind are complementary if the sunny season is not the windy season; models find that a combination of both is typically less expensive than either alone.</p>

            <p>Because solar and wind conditions vary across the landscape, system costs fall as a production area grows, so there needs to be a robust electric grid to move electricity from places where there is supply to places of demand. We also need more electricity for applications like transportation that currently use fossil fuels. This means the grid must grow.

            Studies show that running an electric grid with variable renewable energy will include not using, or dumping, some energy at times, a strategy that reduces cost compared to always storing surplus energy.</p>

            <p>A future renewable electricity grid with associated electrification may or may not reduce energy costs. But avoiding the worst effects of climate change means quitting fossil fuels, whether or not this saves money. Still, the renewable transition will be faster and politically easier if it is less expensive.

              In Mauritius, our study finds renewable electricity costs to be similar to present costs there, based on current capital costs for renewable energy. Some studies also find costs for future renewable electricity to be lower than present fossil-fuel costs, in the likely event that costs fall as we build more renewable energy systems and get better at doing it.  </p>


            <p>A project on the scale of transforming the energy system will create jobs – many jobs – which is perhaps the economic measure of most importance to the citizenry.</p>

            <h2>Big US Rate Cut</h2>
            <h5>Implications of a Federal Reserve Rate cut and the Indian government's recent proposal to ban e-cigarettes.</h5>

            <p>On September 11th 2019, Donald Trump opened his twitter account and put this out on the public domain, for the whole world to see.

            The Federal Reserve should get our interest rates down to ZERO, or less, and we should then start to refinance our debt. INTEREST COST COULD BE BROUGHT WAY DOWN…The USA should always be paying the lowest rate. No Inflation! It is only the naïveté of Jay Powell and the Federal Reserve that doesn’t allow us to do what other countries are already doing. A once in a lifetime opportunity that we are missing because of “Boneheads.”</p>


            <p>When the US Central Bank cuts rates, it’s a day to celebrate. Well.. maybe not for everyone, but it is a pretty eventful day for most people. Borrowing money becomes cheaper. People can spend on stuff that they don’t need. And the economy gets a good kick out of this whole thing.

            However, as the chairman of the US Central Bank, Jay Powell recently noted- “A cut in interest is like an insurance”. It’s only meant to be used in desperate times and it doesn’t seem as if the US economy is exactly in ruins right now.</p>

            <p>Unemployment levels in the US are at record lows, growth has been decent and despite the odd trouble with the trade war, the US economy is doing alright. So why this verbal tirade now? Why is Donald Trump so agitated?

            That is an excellent question.

            See, when you’re a president of the United States trying to win a re-election, your concerns are restricted to the more immediate future.

            Think of it this way. Right now almost every investor in the US believes that the economy needs a booster shot, especially with all this talk about an impending recession.</p>

            <p>Oh btw, the implication of a cut in interest rates is going to be far-reaching and the ripples will reach Indian shores eventually. Once people realise that they can’t make as much interest income with US governments bonds, they might as well choose to bring some of that money to India.

            And most people think that this will improve sentiments back home.</p>

            <h2>Black Money Agreement</h2>
            <h5>New developments in India’s Black Money War. And, the uncertain future facing India’s pharmaceutical giants</h5>

            <p>So, India will finally be able to get its hands on information regarding financial accounts of Indian residents in Swiss Banks. This information will be shared with India as part of an information-sharing pact signed between the two countries to verify whether taxpayers have been honest about their tax returns. So is the massive political promise from the old days of fighting corruption finally coming to fruition?</p>


            <p>Well… Yes… At least partially.

            For one, the sharing agreement is bound by strict confidentiality clauses — meaning there won’t be some list circulated among the masses for us to then name and shame these people. There won’t be any news debates, no billboards, no names taken, no nothing.

            In fact, any deviation from the confidentiality agreement will render the agreement null and void and it will probably be the last time India ever gets any information from Swiss tax authorities. Instead, the information provided under the agreement can then be used to build a prosecution case back home. So if the Indian tax authorities suspect willful tax evasion they can then use this data to strengthen their case.</p>

            <p>Also, it’s believed that many Indians simply closed their accounts and bailed after the Swiss government agreed to share these sensitive details back in 2017. In fact, it’s one of the few reasons why India is pursuing a separate matter with the Swiss authorities on about 100 individuals suspected of having closed their accounts once they got wind of this development. So that’s something that’s still in the works.</p>

            <p>In any case, this crusade against black money is not as straightforward as many people would have liked. But hey, it’s still progress and hopefully, it’ll act as a nice deterrent for anybody thinking of stashing money abroad.</p>

            <h2>Fire at Aramco</h2>
            <h5>Drones began to fire at two major production facilities of the largest oil producer in the world (Saudi Aramco), affecting half of its production capacity.</h5>

            <p>The fire at the facility is now under control and rebel groups from Yemen have taken responsibility for the attack. Meanwhile, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has assured everyone that this will not affect regular supply and all will be well within a matter of a couple of days.

            However, if reports are to be believed, those couple days might actually be a few weeks.

            And that means trouble.</p>

            <p>Even those who don’t take an active interest in matters of economics will almost immediately tell you about India’s dependence on oil. When oil prices trend upwards, chaos ensues in the streets of India. This much is well documented. So clearly, this disruption in oil supply can’t be a good thing for India.</p>

            <p>However, before you take to the streets with brickbats and broken roof tiles, hear us out, will you? It’s not like this disruption spells the doom for India either. For one, Saudi has a bit of oil stocked up, just for emergencies like these. So that’ll come in handy now. And India has its own buffer. I mean, it’s not like our government is always ill-prepared. Sometimes they do have a plan.However, we don’t think the price will stay even for now. It’s most likely to trend upwards and eventually when India can no longer swim against the tide and that buffer starts running out, petrol and diesel prices will slowly start inching up as well.</p>

            <p>What’s a difficult question to answer. Currently, we are at about $60 a barrel. The experts are saying that we could see a $5–7 hike in oil prices.

            But the real question is this - Considering about 5% of total oil production is now at stake, why wouldn’t the price go wayyy up. Like a $100 dollars maybe?

            Well… That’s because countries simply won't let oil prices spiral out of control. For one, the US will most likely ramp up its production because it’s right about at the $60 mark where fracking becomes economical. And for those who’re wondering what fracking is?

            It's a complicated technique mostly deployed by US oil producers where they drill deep down into the earth's surface and pump a lot of high-pressure water to release all that trapped gas. It’s not as cheap as what the guys at Saudi have got going with their oil, but if prices keep escalating, fracking becomes a very enticing opportunity.</p>

            <h2>Nuclear War</h2>
            <h5>An India-Pakistan nuclear war could kill millions, threaten global starvation</h5>

            <p>A new study conducted by researchers from the University of Colorado Boulder and Rutgers University examines how such a hypothetical future conflict would have consequences that could ripple across the globe. Today, India and Pakistan each have about 150 nuclear warheads at their disposal, and that number is expected to climb to more than 200 by 2025.

            The picture is grim. That level of warfare wouldn't just kill millions of people locally, said CU Boulder's Brian Toon, who led the research published today in the journal Science Advances. It might also plunge the entire planet into a severe cold spell, possibly with temperatures not seen since the last Ice Age.</p>


            <p>"An India-Pakistan war could double the normal death rate in the world," said Toon, a professor in the Laboratory of Atmospheric and Space Physics. "This is a war that would have no precedent in human experience."

            It's a subject that Toon, also of the Department of Atmospheric and Ocean Sciences, has had on his mind for decades.

            He came of age during the height of the Cold War when schoolchildren still practiced ducking-and-covering under their desks. As a young atmospheric scientist in the early 1980s, he was part of a group of researchers who first coined the term "nuclear winter" -- a period of extreme cold that would likely follow a large-scale nuclear barrage between the U.S. and Russia.</p>

            <p>In his latest study, Toon and his colleagues wanted to find out just how bad such a conflict could get. To do that, the team drew on a wide range of evidence, from computer simulations of Earth's atmosphere to accounts of the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan in 1945.

            Based on their analysis, the devastation would come in several stages.</p>

            <p>"Our experiment, conducted with a state-of-the-art Earth system model, reveals large-scale reductions in the productivity of plants on land and of algae in the ocean, with dangerous consequences for organisms higher on the food chain, including humans," said study coauthor Nicole Lovenduski, an associate professor of atmospheric and oceanic sciences and a fellow of the Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research (INSTAAR).

            Toon recognizes that the scope of such a war may be hard for people to wrap their heads around. But he hopes that the study will show people around the world that the end of the Cold War didn't eliminate the risk of global nuclear war.</p>

            <h2>Are we going electric?</h2>
            <h5>India's faltering EV mission and the big stake sale of Bharat Petroleum Corporation Limited</h5>

            <p>For years now, our government has been gunning to promote Electric vehicles in an attempt to go green. So it might come as a shock to most people that the country sold only 8000 electric vehicles in the past 6 years. That is a rather dismal figure considering we sell hundreds and thousands of conventional vehicles every month. So what gives?

            Well, the most obvious thing everyone points to is the infrastructure. In fact, there was a study last year suggesting that close to 90% of all car owners were willing to go electric if only India provided the necessary infrastructure, a sort of a nationwide charging grid.</p>

            <p>For instance, when Hyundai launched its first electric car “Kona” this year, there was considerable optimism surrounding the event. However, when people found out what the thing cost, optimism quickly gave way to disappointment. At an on-road price of around 25 lakhs, this is a luxury vehicle. It’s like trying to buy three mid-range cars when a large part of the population still can’t afford one.

            And then there is another concern. The large automakers that could perhaps bring down the cost of Electric Vehicles simply don’t have enough incentives to do so. For the past few years, they’ve been making large investments in creating a pipeline to produce BS-VI compliant engines. These are the more eco-friendly alternatives to the ones that are currently being sold. And since these investments are sizeable, companies would want to earn a fair return on the capital (money) employed. So they’ll want to stay away from this party for at least the next 5 years.</p>

            <p>For the uninitiated, BPCL is responsible for refining and marketing (selling) different kinds of petroleum products. The government had already sold large chunks of the company earlier. However, many people thought a full sale wasn’t possible because of the wording of the BPCL nationalisation act which explicitly prevents the government from doing so. Until yesterday when somebody noticed that the government had already repealed the act back in 2016. So technically there isn't anything holding the government back now and we could be looking at a fully private BPCL very soon. </p>

            <p>For one, a private entity can set its own prices. Yes, a government-owned entity like IOCL (Indian Oil Corporation Limited) can also set its own prices. But the government has a different agenda. If an election were approaching tomorrow and fuel prices were soaring high, the government might choose to take a hit on its profits to appease the masses. A private sector entity has no such compulsions.</p>

            <h2>Super Computer</h2>
            <h5>Supercomputer simulates 77,000 neurons in the brain in real-time</h5>

            <p>A brain-inspired computer can now simulate part of the sensory cortex in real time, using tens of thousands of virtual neurons. It is the first time such a complex simulation has run this fast and could be an important step towards building better brains for robots.

            The SpiNNaker supercomputer at the University of Manchester, UK, features 57,000 specialised chips with a total of 1 million processing units, known as cores. It is designed to run programs.</p>

            <p>A study of brains aged between 43 and 87 suggests we may continue to make new brain cells throughout our lives. The finding could mean that adult brains are more capable of recovering from damage than we thought.

            Although many of our tissues and organs renew themselves throughout our lives, it is thought that neurogenesis – the growth of new neurons – rarely occurs in adults. Now María Llorens-Martín at the Severo Ochoa Molecular Biology Centre in Spain and her colleagues have studied brain tissue samples from 13 deceased adults, looking for signs of new brain cells.

            New neurons are made in the hippocampus – a region of the brain key to learning and memory – and as they mature from young to old, they make certain proteins. To identify these new cells, the team used four types of antibodies to detect these proteins, and found that they were all drawn to thousands of neurons across the samples.
            </p>

            <p>The hippocampus is one of the brain regions most affected by Alzheimer’s disease. Llorens-Martín and her team also examined brain tissue from 45 people with Alzheimer’s who died between age 52 and 97. They saw that these brains had fewer cells making the proteins associated with maturing neurons. Those who had more severe Alzheimer’s when they died had fewer of these proteins than those who had milder symptoms.</p>

            <h2>Never Ending Loop</h2>
            <h5>The Big Bad Debt Problem</h5>

            <p>A letter from Prime Minister’s Office on Wednesday said that “road infrastructure has become financially unviable” and that NHAI is “totally log jammed with unplanned and excessive expansion of roads”NHAI is the National Highways Authority of India and its primary responsibility is to build and maintain roads.</p>


            <p>Its preferred method to get the job done is to deploy what is called the BOT model.

            The Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) model, as the name suggests is a way for NHAI to offload its responsibilities of road building to private contractors. These private contractors build the road, operate it, make money off of collecting toll and after about 10–15 years, they hand over the road back to NHAI.

            However, there aren’t enough private contractors willing to bid for such projects because — hey, maintaining and operating a road is a pain, especially if you have to wait 15 years to recoup all the money you had to pour in to build the damn thing.</p>

            <p>The larger issue here is, that when NHAI raises money from people outside the government it promises to pay it back with interest. And in the off chance that it can’t pay back back the money, it simply goes out and borrows some more.

            This is because NHAI really has no income to speak of.

            When NHAI collects toll from you when you ferry your best friend across the Mumbai-Pune Express highway, that money goes to the government.

            NHAI is simply an executioner. It's not the brains behind the scheme. So technically all this borrowing is the government’s headache and this much should be common knowledge. Unfortunately, it isn’t.</p>

            <p>The fiscal deficit (read as total money spent by the government in excess of the total income earned) stood at 3.4% of the country’s GDP.

            And if we have to be honest with you here, it’s a pretty decent number. However, this is the government’s version of the fiscal deficit.</p>

            <h5>The RBI has now made it mandatory for banks to link all floating rate loans to an external benchmark and we need to talk about this.</h5>

            <p>Now before we dissect this story, we need some context. Currently, you could walk into a bank and ask for a home loan and banks will set you up with one, after asking if you’d prefer a fixed-rate interest or a floating rate, more commonly referred to as the Marginal Cost of Funds based Lending Rate (MCLR)
            Now the MCLR is a tricky little bugger. It’s like a bare minimum rate below which banks can’t lend. Now obviously banks add a nice little top up on the MCLR to maintain their margins. But they do a review of the MCLR every once in a while and change it if they think there is scope for change.</p>

            <p>In the off chance that the MCLR is lowered, your home loan EMI immediately turns cheaper as well. And so, unlike a fixed-rate loan, where the interest rate remains constant throughout the repayment period. MCLR offers flexibility.

            Unfortunately, the way banks calculate this funny little thing, most of the flexibility, accrues to the bank and not to the end customer.

            In fact, the reason why RBI mandated banks to use MCLR in the first place was because they had hoped banks would be more flexible in cutting interest rates when RBI cuts its rate</p>

            <p>ecause obviously, if banks can now borrow at cheaper rates from the RBI you’d expect to see some of that benefits trickle down to the customers as well. Right?

            However, that did not happen because banks calculate MCLR by considering their total cost of borrowing, not just the cost of borrowing from the RBI i.e. the interest they’ll have to pay on the money they borrow.

            In fact, a significant part of the bank’s borrowings comes from you lot, when you tie up money in a fixed deposit. And banks can always contest that reducing rates is simply not feasible because they’re offering a pretty high return on all those FD’s. So your loan EMI continue to stay high despite repeated rate cuts by the RBI.</p>

            <p>The Fix

            Now, this does not bode well for anybody, especially if you’re trying to stimulate the economy by enticing people to borrow more. RBI needs to see more action when it cuts interest rates. And it doesn’t want to wait for a year to see a tiny 0.05% cut on your home loan EMI when it has already cut rates by about 0.5%.

            So, it’s been thinking about fixing this.

            And the best way to do it is to simply force banks to link all floating loans to an external benchmark, like the RBI’s repo rate (the rate RBI charges banks when it lends to them for short durations)</p>

            <h2>Game Changer</h2>
            <h5>About corporate tax cuts, the government’s plan to run a fire sale, PMC Bank fiasco and a review of the IRCTC IPO.</h5>

            <p>We begin by discussing the downsides of a corporate tax cut. Now it’s no secret that the government has been touting this as a potential game-changer. And to be honest with you, it probably is. In fact, even we covered this last week and talked about how the move could potentially revive demand and maybe spur corporates to invest more.</p>


            <p>But here’s the thing. It also means that the government will have to take a serious hit on its coffers. They are currently foregoing 1.45 Lakh crore in revenues while explicitly stating that they have no intention to cut down on spending. This is a rather risky bet. How risky exactly? </p>

            <p>If you include all the money borrowed by other government-owned entities like Food Corporation of India and NHAI (the guys that build roads), fiscal deficit shoots up to a whopping 5.8%. Now technically all this is still government borrowing, but they refused to admit this much. And with Saturday’s move, this number might shoot up to ~7%. The most obvious impact of government borrowing is that it reduces the pool of available funds for others. Everybody wants to borrow and if the government walks in and borrows a whole lot of money, it crowds out other corporates. They might have to pay a higher interest rate if they still want to fight it out.</p>

            <p>So the work that went into reviving the investment engine could be undone if the government continues with its reckless borrowing program.
            Hopefully, the government figures out a way to reign in the fiscal deficit before then.</p>
